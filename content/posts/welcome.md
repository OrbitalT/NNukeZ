Welcome traveler, you've come a long distance to find this place so take a seat while I talk about a few things.
 
This is the official blog / repository for Nostalgic NukeZ (a.k.a Bryce) who started on Youtube back in 2015 but with new Youtube rules and a changed platform the channel was unlisted in 2019. In light of this change and an increased knowledge of the internet the NNukeZ name will live on, plans for posts about cool software, gaming videos (which) include the old LeD Clan and informational content are currently in the works and will be posted here for all to see.
 
This site is still in development and more features will be added in the future to better support NNukeZ and the community. Plans and support for Live Streaming and comments are in the works but no date is set as of (7/5/2021)

A curated list of videos from the Nostalgic NukeZ and Clan LeD youtube channels will be making a return aswell. For now the videos will be hosted on NNukeZ private servers but hopes to switch to the IPFS network is planned for future.
